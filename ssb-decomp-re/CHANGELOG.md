# Character Lab changes

## Donor collision paths — 2026-10-02

- Kirby up-tilt collision trajectory on all eleven foreign original-roster bodies,
  including the selected body's three up-tilt variants when applicable.
- Shared donor-relative collision layer; Falcon down-air, Fox straight forward
  tilt and DK straight forward smash trajectories now work across bodies too.
- Donor sizes, event windows, damage/knockback and recovery stay on the existing
  attack clock. Collision updates preserve hit records and swept-position history.
- Body animations remain native outside the three existing Mario pose pilots.
- Geometry is checked against original native playback/matrices, including target
  size, position and both facings. In-game acceptance remains pending.

## Next release — repository setup

- Newcomer README, feature checklist, play/build guides and release instructions.
- One build command that verifies the ROM and creates a play package under `dist/`.
- Automatic build/release workflow for pushes to `main`, manual runs and `v*` tags.
- Fixed download filenames, source commit information and SHA-256 checksums.
- Compiler emulator setup keeps verified compatibility libraries locally on Ubuntu 22.04.

## Current gameplay build

- Training tests return to the same build's character editor (`62f65219e`).
- Neutral B can select Body Move or Fox Laser. Foreign-body lasers use a finite
  firing action; DK no longer runs his charge loop underneath a laser.
- DK skips cargo carry when another fighter's forward throw is selected (`8cb8b29bf`).
- Three Mario animation pilots: Falcon down air, Fox straight forward tilt,
  DK straight forward smash (`ad41465b1`). Numeric verification passed; visual review pending.
- Original donor normal-attack timing, hitbox values and knockback, plus mapped
  grab timing and numeric forward/back throw customization.
- Four presets, human/CPU assignments in VS, Training HITBOX view, native menu
  styling, unlockable fighters and Item Switch.
